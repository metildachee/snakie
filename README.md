The game starts off easy, with the snake moving slowly and having more hamburgers.

As the levels get more difficult, the speed of the snake increases and barriers are included..

... and more barriers... you get it..

### Limitations
* Note, this is the only option if you choose to play the game online.
* Also note, this game is not supported on mobile.
* Scores are not recorded.

## Snakie version 2 - Record scores
Snakie now features a single player mode and a leaderboard mode with score recording ability.

### How to play?
Players can visit [Snakie version 2](https://snakie.herokuapp.com/) to play.

### How does the game work?

#### Single player mode
Players can choose to either:

1. Login with Github. This allows the user to record their scores on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/), [sample](https://gist.github.com/metildachee/d13d4c3c249223f30282c6d2942d3b74)

2. Or play with a standard username.

##### Login using Github

Players are prompted for their Github username and password.

After which, a `snake_logs` Gist will be created; should the player not have played before, the file will be created. 

Should the file already exist, previous scores will be updated in the highscore board.

Logs are updated as the player plays.

... you get the gist.

##### Standard username

This is [Snakie version 1](#snakie-version-1)

#### Leaderboard mode

This mode allows anyone to make a highscore on the [leaderboard](https://gist.github.com/metildachee/4236c7cab8ae755ce2800703d6588d68).

##### Login using Github 
To play leaderboard mode, players must login to Github.

A new player will be given instructions on how to play.

A seasoned player will be shown a welcome page and their scores will be updated.

Only the top 3 and current player's scores are updated, this allows the player to see how far they have to the top score.

If the player is already in the top rank... congrats!

### Limitations 
1. Grossly insecure; iykyk
2. Blatantly inadequate approach
3. Slow performance and many deprecations
4. Single player must have at least 1 Gist on their account, otherwise application will have unpredictable behaviour
5. No mobile too ðŸ˜…

## Snakie version 3 - Real time multi-player (coming soon)
This version would allow multiple players to play at the same time.

## What can be done better?
Wayyy... too many, these are just the one top of my head.
* UX orientated
* Writing better code
* Staying calm
* Being adventurous
* .... ++
